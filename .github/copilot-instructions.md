# QuantumForce_Code: Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## 1. Project Overview
QuantumForce_Code is a cyberpunk-themed automotive diagnostics AI platform. The codebase is currently a skeleton, containing only `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`. All other files have been removed for a fresh start.

## 2. Key Files
- `README.md`: Contains project vision, target users, and a summary of planned architecture and documentation files. Use this as the primary source for understanding the project's goals and thematic style.
- `AGENTS.md`: Defines agent permissions, project type, and stylistic guidelines. AI agents have full read-write access and should follow the cyberpunk automotive theme, use emojis, and provide technical documentation.

## 3. Architecture & Patterns
- The architecture is not yet implemented. Future structure will include:
  - AI-powered diagnostic modules
  - OBD-II integration
  - Business logic for auto service workflows
  - Data analytics and reporting
- All new code should be modular, well-documented, and follow the cyberpunk/techno-futuristic style described in `README.md`.

## 4. Developer Workflow
- No build, test, or deployment scripts currently exist. When adding these, document all commands and workflows in the README or a dedicated guide.
- Use clear, numbered comments for all major code blocks to help future agents and developers understand logic and flow.

## 5. Conventions & Guidelines
- Use Ukrainian and English for documentation and code comments.
- Prefer emoji and technical terminology for user-facing text.
- Reference `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` for thematic and permission guidance.
- When creating new files, add a short header comment explaining the file's purpose and its role in the overall architecture.

## 6. Integration Points
- No external dependencies or integrations are present yet. When adding, document them clearly in the README and relevant code files.

## 7. Example: File Header
```python
# 1. File Purpose: Implements core AI diagnostic logic for QuantumForce_Code
# 2. Role: Main entry point for vehicle data analysis and reporting
# ...existing code...
```

## 8. Next Steps for AI Agents
- Propose and scaffold new modules based on the README vision
- Document all new workflows and architectural decisions
- Maintain the cyberpunk automotive theme throughout code and docs
